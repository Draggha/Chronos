# Chronos
A kind of diary.

Chronos is a weird way to write the name of one of the legendary apocalyptic riders. I used it because he stands for time and enthropy.

Everything erodes given time. Everything once will be forgotten. But Chronos will make sure, that your experiences will survive far longer
than your memories last. Chronos is here to help you persist your experiences and/or thoughts. It will mostly be configured for documenting
pen & paper roleplay experiences, but can also be used in many other kinds of ways.

The following features will be aspired (suggestions welcome!):

+ O Persist your story
+ O Bring your story in your own timeline
+ O Add metadata to your stories, like who was there and what items were important (these will be linked and show a little tooltip teaser)
+ O Manage a chronicle as a group (with authorization and visibility and/or editing restrictions)
+ O Add Doodle-like functions so your group can arrange its next meetup without the need to use another platform that just grabs your data.
+ O Add collaboration functions (multiple users editing the same document, maybe a chat to discourse) so your group can get better at authoring stuff
+ O Import and Export your data
+ O Make this app run completely locally and offline (with an option to sync to remote)

## Prerequesites
You need the following software:

+ Node.js (or io.js)
+ Apache CouchDB
+ Git
+ [Hoodie](http://www.hood.ie)
+ [JSPM](http://www.jspm.io)

Then just do the following:

`
npm install
`

and

`
jspm install
`

That should be enough to get the development version working.
